# Motivation

- Big data problem: data is too big to fit into memory (=local environment).
- R reads data into random-access memory (RAM) at once and this object lives in memory entirely. So, object > memory will crash R. 
- So, the key to deal with big data in R is reducing the size of data you want to bring into it.

**Techniques to deal with big data**

- Medium sized file (1-2 GB)
   - Try to reduce the size of the file using slicing and dicing
   - Tools: 
      - R:`data.table::fread(file path, select = c("column 1", "column 2"))`. This command imports data faster than `read.csv()` does.
      - Command line: [`csvkit`](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a suite of command-line tools to and working with CSV 
- Large file (> 2-10 GB)
   - Put the data into a database and **ACCESS** it 
   - Explore the data and pull the objects of interest 
   - Types of databases
      - Relational database = a collection of tables (fixed columns and rows): SQL is a staple tool to define and **query** (focus of the workshop today) this type of database
      - Non-relational database = a collection of documents (MongoDB), key-values (Redis and DyanoDB), wide-column stores (Cassandra and HBase), or graph (Neo4j and JanusGraph). This type of database does not preclude SQL. Note that NoSQL stands for ["not only SQL."](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)

# What is SQL? 

- Structured Query Language. Called SEQUEL and developed by IBM Corporation in the 1970s.

- Remains the standard language for a relational database management system.

- It's a DECLARATIVE language ([what to do > how to do](https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html))
  - Database management systems figures optimal way to execute query (query optimization)
    
```sql
SELECT COLUMN FROM TABLE 
```

# Learning objectives 

> * Embracing a new mindset: shifting from ownership (opening CSVs in your laptop) to access (accessing data stored in a database)

> * Learning how to use R and SQL to access and query a database

* SQL and R

SQL           | R
------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT        | select() for columns, mutate() for expressions, summarise() for aggregates
FROM          | which data frame 
WHERE         | filter()
GROUP BY      | group_by()
HAVING        | filter() **after group_by()**
ORDER BY      | arrange()
LIMIT         | head()
  
**Challenge 1**
1. Can you tell me the difference in the order in which the following `R` and `SQL` code were written to wrangle data? For instance, in R, what command comes first? In contrast, in SQL, what command comes first?

- R example 

```r

data %>% # Data 
  select() %>% # Column
  filter() %>% # Row 
  group_by() %>% # Group by 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% # Aggregation
  filter() %>% # Row 
  order_by() # Arrange 

```

- SQL example 

```sql 

SELECT column, aggregation (count())` # Column

FROM data # Data 

WHERE condition # Row 

GROUP BY column # Group by

HAVING condition # Row  

ORDER BY column # Arrange 

```

# Setup

Let's get to work. 

## Packages 

- `pacman::p_load()` reduces steps for installing and loading several packages simultaneously. 

```{r}

# pacman 
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

# The rest of pkgs 
pacman::p_load(
 
 tidyverse, # tidyverse packages 
 
 DBI, # using SQL queries
 
 RSQLite, # SQLite
 
 dbplyr, # use database with dplyr 
 
 glue, # glue to automate workflow 
 
 nycflights13 # toy data 
)

```

## Data sets 

- [The flight on-time performance data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236) from the Bureau of Transpiration Statistics of the U.S. government. The data goes back to 1987 and its size is more than 20 gigabytes. For practice, we only use a small subset of the original data (flight data departing NYC in 2013) provided by RStudio.

# Workflow 

1. Create and connect to a database 

- ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/500px-Client-server-model.svg.png)

- Note that server also can be your laptop (called [localhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost#:~:text=In%20computer%20networking%2C%20localhost%20is,via%20the%20loopback%20network%20interface.)).

- Short answer: To do so, you need interfaces between R and a database. We use [`RSQLite`](https://github.com/r-dbi/RSQLite) in this tutorial because it's easy to set up. 

- Long answer: The `DBI` package in R provides a client-side interface that allows `dplyr` to work with databases. DBI is automatically installed when you installed `dbplyr`. However, you need to install a specific backend engine (a tool for communication between R and a database management system) for the database (e.g., `RMariaDB`, `RPostgres`, `RSQLite`). In this workshop, we use SQLite because it is the easiest to get started with. Personally, I love PostgreSQL because it's an open-source and also powerful to do [many amazing things](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions.html) (e.g., text mining, geospatial analysis).

2. Copy a table to the database 

- Option 1: You can create a table and insert rows manually.

- Table
    - Collection of rows 
    - Collection of columns (fields or attributes)
    - Each col has a type:
        - String: `VARCHAR(20)`
        - Integer: `INTEGER`
        - Floating-point: `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`
        - Date/time: `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`
    - **Schema**: the structure of the database
        - The table name
        - The names and types of its columns
        - Various optional additional information (e.g., constraints)
        
```sql

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(30),
    birth DATE,
    gpa FLOAT,
    grad INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(id));
    
INSERT INTO students(name, birth, gpa, grad)
      VALUES ('Adam', '2000-08-04', 4.0, 2020);

```

- Option 2: Copy a file (object) to a table in a database using `copy_to`). We take this option as it's fast and we would like to focus on querying in this workshop. 

3. Query the table 

- Main focus 

4. Pull the results of interests (**data**) using `collect()`

5. Disconnect the database 

# Create a database 

```{r}

# Define a backend engine 

drv <- RSQLite::SQLite()

# Create an empty in-memory database 
con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv, 
                      dbname = ":memory:")

# Connect to an existing database 
#con <- DBI::dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
 # host = "database.rstudio.com",
 # user = "hadley",
 # password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
#)

dbListTables(con)

```

- Note that con is empty at this stage.

# Copy an object as a table to the database (push)

```{r}

# Copy objects to the data 
copy_to(dest = con, 
        df = flights)

copy_to(dest = con, 
        df = airports)

copy_to(dest = con,
        df = planes)

copy_to(dest = con, 
        df = weather)

# If you want you can also decide what columns you want to copy:

# copy_to(dest = con, 
#          df = flights, 
#          name = "flights",
#          indexes = list(c("year", "tailnum", "dest")))

```


```{r basic information on tables and fields}

# Show two tables in the database 

dbListTables(con)

# Show the columns/attributes/fields of a table 

dbListFields(con, "flights")

dbListFields(con, "weather")

```

# Quick demonstrations:

- SELECT desired columns 
- FROM tables 

- Select all columns (*) from `flights` table and show the `first ten rows`
- Note that you can combine SQL and R commands thanks to `dbplyr`.

- Option 1 

```{r}

DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM flights;") %>%
  head(10) 

```

- Option 2 (works faster)

```{sql, connection = con}

SELECT * 
FROM flights 
LIMIT 5

```

- Option 3 (automating workflow)

  - When local variables are updated, the SQL query is also automatically updated.

```{r}

# Local variables 
tbl <- "flights"
var <- "dep_delay"
num <- 5

# Glue SQL query string 
# Note that to indicate a numeric value, you don't need ``

sql_query <- glue_sql("
  SELECT {`var`}
  FROM {`tbl`}
  LIMIT {num} 
  ", .con = con)

# Run the query 
dbGetQuery(con, sql_query)

```

**Challenge 2** 
Can you rewrite the above code using `LIMIT` instead of `head(10)`

- You may notice that using only SQL code makes querying faster.

- Select dep_delay and arr_delay from flights table, show the first ten rows, then turn the result into a tibble.

**Challenge 3**
Could you remind me how to see the list of attributes of a table? Let's say you want to see the attributes of `flights` table. 

- Collect the selected columns and filtered rows 

```{r}

df <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT dep_delay, arr_delay FROM flights;") %>%
  head(10) %>%
  collect()

```
  
- Counting rows 

  - Count all (*)
  
```{r}

dbGetQuery(con, 
          "SELECT COUNT(*) 
           FROM flights;") 

```
  
```{r}

dbGetQuery(con, 
           "SELECT COUNT(dep_delay)
           FROM flights;")

```

  - Count distinct values 
  
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, 
           "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dep_delay)
           FROM flights;")

```


# Tidy-way: dplyr -> SQL

Thanks to the `dbplyr` package you can use the `dplyr` syntax to query SQL. 

- Note that pipe (%) works.

```{r}

# tbl select tables
flights <- con %>% tbl("flights")
airports <- con %>% tbl("airports")
planes <- con %>% tbl("planes")
weather <- con %>% tbl("weather")

```

## `select` = `SELECT`

```{r}

flights %>% 
  select(contains("delay"))

```
**Challenge 4** 
Your turn: write the same code in SQL 

## `mutate` = `SELECT` `AS`

```{r}

flights %>%
  select(distance, air_time) %>%  
  mutate(speed = distance / (air_time / 60)) 

```
**Challenge 5** 
Your turn: write the same code in SQL (hint: `mutate(new_var = var 1 * var2` = `SELECT var1 * var2 AS near_var`)

## `filter` = `WHERE` 

```{r}

flights %>% 
  filter(month == 1, day == 1)

```
**Challenge 6** 
Your turn: write the same code in SQL (hint: `filter(condition1, condition2)` = `WHERE condition1 and condition2`)

- Note that R and SQL operators are not exactly alike. R uses `!=` for `Not equal to`. SQL uses `<>` or `!=`. Furthermore, there are some cautions about using `NULL` (NA; unknown or missing): it should be `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` not `=NULL` or `!=NULL`. 

## `arrange` = `ORDER BY`

```{r}

flights %>% 
  arrange(carrier, desc(arr_delay)) %>%
  show_query()

```
**Challenge 7** 
Your turn: write the same code in SQL (hint: `arrange(var1, desc(var2)) = ORDER BY var1, var2 DESC`)

## `summarise` = `SELECT` `AS` and `group by` = `GROUP BY`

```{r}

flights %>%
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay)) 

```
**Challenge 8** 
Your turn: write the same code in SQL (hint: in SQL the order should be `SELECT group_var1, group_var2, AVG(old_var) AS new_var` -> `FROM` -> `GROUP BY`)

- If you feel too much challenged, here's a help.

```{r}

flights %>%
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  show_query() # Show the SQL equivalent!

```
## Joins 

- Using joins is simpler in R than it is in SQL.

![](https://external-preview.redd.it/DmVn0-iEjJBsj4ndXaivDh2Ul5-JWi6UlwZ5U5nYnmc.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=5ce57d6fd68eda022ac8784170614f012f57680f)

- However, more flexible joins exist in SQL and they are not available in R. 

  - Joins involving 3+ tables are not supported.
  - Some advanced joins available in SQL are not supported. 
  - For more information, check out [`tidyquery`](https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery/issues) to see the latest developments.

  
```{r}

flights %>% 
  left_join(weather, by = c("year", "month")) %>%
  show_query()

```

# Collect (pull)

* `collect()` is used to pull the data. Depending on the data size, it may take a long time to run.

- The following code won't work.

> Error in UseMethod("collect") : no applicable method for 'collect' applied to an object of class "c('LayerInstance', 'Layer', 'ggproto', 'gg')"

```{r eval = FALSE}

origin_flights_plot <- flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = origin, y = n)) %>%
  collect()

```

- This works. 

```{r}
df <- flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  tally() %>%
  collect()

origin_flights_plot <- ggplot(df) +
  geom_col(aes(x = origin, y = n))

origin_flights_plot
```

# Disconnect 

```{r}

DBI::dbDisconnect(con)

```
